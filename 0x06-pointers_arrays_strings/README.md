More pointers, strings and arrays 

==> Task 2. _strncpy
It was important to take note of buffer overflow
* This prompted the use of j to subscript dest to paste copied characters at element 0 as required.
* The function is similar to strncat, except the need for subscipting to paste at desired location.
==> Task 3. _strcmp
Comparing strings require the use of the operators < and >
* I assigned the required return value to a variable 'value'
* Need to fix the error: return int * instead of int!!!
